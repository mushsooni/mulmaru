# 물마루 | Mulmaru
**Bold** yet _Smooth_ Korean Pixel Font
![01_title](images/01_title.png)



## Introduction
**Mulmaru** is a font project born from the need for better typography in Korean pixel game localization.

While working on Korean translations for games, I often struggled to find a font that matched the aesthetic of the original titles.  
I felt there was a gap in the available options: existing fonts were either too large (like the 16px DungGeunMo<sup>[[1]](https://cactus.tistory.com/193) [[2]](https://github.com/neodgm/neodgm)</sup>) or, if smaller, lacked the necessary weight or readability like [Galmuri](https://github.com/quiple/galmuri).

After discovering [Pixel Font Maker](https://github.com/exqt/pixel-font-maker) by exqt, I decided to create the font I had always envisioned.
![02_intro](images/02_intro.png)
Mulmaru matches the size of Galmuri 11 but adopts the thick vertical strokes and rounded edges characteristic of DungGeunMo, resulting in a distinct sans-serif pixel style.

The Korean glyphs are primarily inspired by [Yoon px Arcade](https://font.co.kr/collection/sub?family_idx=10627). They were redesigned and refined using the [10x6x4 combination](https://github.com/exqt/pixel-font-maker?tab=readme-ov-file#minzkn님-10x6x4벌식-글꼴) template as a base.
